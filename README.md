### Hi there 👋
🔭 I’m currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Calgary. My research is centred around Deep Learning for Healthcare and Precision Medicine. I am currently working on applying Deep Learning techniques to enhance Digital Twins in Cancer treatment. 
I'm a seasoned software developer, having previously worked at Credit Suisse (UBS) in the Investment Banking and Operations departments and developed and contributed to mission-critical projects.
🌱 I’m a passionate and results-driven software engineer with a keen interest in building products to solve real-world problems. 
⚡ I'm currently a Graduate Researcher at the ADSA Lab @ UCalgary. 
📫 How to reach me: Email- annettejohn31@gmail.com 
👯 Let's collaborate if you have any ideas on software development so that we can bring them to life!
⚡ Fun fact: I love cats and everything about them :))
