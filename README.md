### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Calgary. My research is centered around the dynamic intersection of databases and network science. 
I'm a seasoned software developer, having previously worked at Credit Suisse (UBS) in the Investment Banking and Operations departments and developed and contributed to mission-critical projects.
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m a passionate and results-driven software engineer with a keen interest in building products to solve real-world problems. 
âš¡ I'm currently a Graduate Researcher at the ADSA Lab @ UCalgary. 
ğŸ“« How to reach me: Email- annettejohn31@gmail.com 
ğŸ‘¯ Let's collaborate if you have any ideas on software development so that we can bring them to life!
âš¡ Fun fact: I love cats and everything about them :))
